## Final Deliverables

### Documentation Package:
```
docs/
├── README.md              # Quick start and overview
├── USER_GUIDE.md          # Complete playing instructions
├── PARENT_GUIDE.md        # Parent mode and analytics
├── INSTALLATION.md        # Setup and running instructions
├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md     # Common issues and solutions
└── FUTURE_ROADMAP.md      # Planned enhancements
```

### Source Code Package:
```
src/                       # Complete source code
bin/                       # Compiled executable
tests/                     # Unit tests and test results
WORK-ITEMS/               # All development documentation
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] MVP meets all original requirements
- [ ] Application runs without errors on Windows
- [ ] Both Parent and Kid modes function correctly
- [ ] All rally series are completable
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Demo materials are prepared
- [ ] Future roadmap is documented

## Final Testing Protocol
1. **Clean Machine Test**: Test on computer without development environment
2. **Age Group Simulation**: Test scenarios for 5, 7, 9, and 12-year-old users
3. **Extended Play Test**: 1+ hour session to check stability
4. **Parent Workflow Test**: Complete parent mode usage scenario
5. **Stress Test**: Rapid inputs, mode switching, edge cases

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Successful 10-minute live demonstration
- [ ] All core features working as designed
- [ ] No critical bugs or crashes
- [ ] Positive user experience feedback
- [ ] Clear path for future development

## Estimated Time: 4-5 hours

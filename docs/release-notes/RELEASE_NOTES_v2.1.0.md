## 🔍 Bug Fixes Details

### 🎯 Achievement Loading Issue (Primary Fix)
**Problem**: When users switched between profiles or restarted the application, previously unlocked achievements were not displaying in the Achievements page UI, even though the data was saved correctly.

**Root Cause**: The AchievementManager was created once during application startup but never updated when the ProfileManager switched to different profiles.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive profile synchronization:
- `LoadDefaultProfileAsync()`: Now calls `AchievementManager.UpdateProfileManager()`
- `LoadProfileAsync()`: Now calls `AchievementManager.UpdateProfileManager()`
- `CreateNewProfileAsync()`: Now calls `AchievementManager.UpdateProfileManager()`
- `ResetProfileAsync()`: Now calls `AchievementManager.UpdateProfileManager()`
- Completely rewrote `LoadAchievementProgress()` to properly reset all achievement states before loading new profile data

### 🔧 User Experience Issues
**Problem**: Users downloading the game from GitHub had difficulty launching it, often seeing terminal windows instead of the pure Windows application.

**Solution**: Created `RUN_GAME.bat` with intelligent executable detection and direct Windows Forms launching.
